As users generate transaction fees, a portion is allocated to an insurance capital pool, which will be used to cover future claims for their insureds, based on their dynamic insurance policy limits. The policy limits for each wallet user depend on their underwriting risk profile and the amount of transaction fees they have generated in relation to the entire capital pool and insured base.</p><p>One of the key features of the WIM SDK is the determination of policy limits, which are re-underwritten every 30 days to keep pace with the ever changing crypto environment. In essence, this acts as a failsafe mechanism, preventing policy limits from surpassing the collective capital pool and actively averting insolvency risks. Essentially, the WIM SDK is designed to remain solvent at all times, ensuring no negative financial impact on any wallet provider.</p><h2>From the Wallet Providers Perspective:</h2><p>The implementation process for wallet providers is quick and simple, consisting of just four simple steps. Notably, it operates seamlessly without requiring any prior insurance expertise or upfront insurance capital, thereby eliminating traditional barriers to entry to the insurance industry. Once the implementation is complete, no ongoing administrative efforts or overhead are required. And wallet providers will gain access to a comprehensive dashboard that provides insurance metrics and user data.</p><h2>From the Wallet User's Perspective:</h2><p>Wallet users will have the choice to enroll in our insurance program and enjoy the advantages of our comprehensive wallet underwriting. They will receive valuable insights into their wallet's risk profile. Opting in is entirely voluntary and comes at no additional cost as users are already contributing transaction fees to their wallet provider for each transaction. Once opted in, a portion of these fees is directed to an insurance capital pool, ensuring funds are available to cover potential insurance claims in the future. And now by showcasing proactive and secure wallet behavior, wallet users have the opportunity to gradually raise their policy limits over time with each underwriting period relative to the growth of the capital pool.</p></div><br><br><footer><div class="footer-links"><a href="https://github.com/inDemniFi" class="footer-link">GitHub</a> <a href="https://indemnifi.gitbook.io/wim-sdk/" class="footer-link">GitBook</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/inDemniFi" class="footer-link">Twitter</a> <a href="https://discord.gg/nw5KTzuDhV" class="footer-link">Discord</a></div></footer><br></body></html>
